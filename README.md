1D Target-Oriented FWI with Marchenko Target Replacement

This Matlab package calculates the velocity model for a specific target within a larger 1D environment. It leverages full waveform inversion (FWI) in combination with Marchenko target replacement to reduce the effects of the internal multiples.

Usage:
Execute the MAIN.m file to initiate the program.

Important:  
This code builds upon theoretical concepts outlined in the following publications. Please ensure proper citation if you utilize this package:
